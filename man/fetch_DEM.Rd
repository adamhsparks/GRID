\title{Fetch and Aggregate a Digital Elevation Model for Use in Interpolating GSOD Data}
\usage{
fetch_DEM(resolution = NULL, dsn = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{resolution}{Resolution to aggregate the digital elevation model to in
arc-degrees, e.g. 1 = 1 arc degree, .25 = one quarter arc degree. Valid
options are 1, .5 and .25 degrees.}

\item{dsn}{Optional. Directory where resulting DEM file is to be saved. If
unspecified a spatial object is returned in the R session.}
}
\value{
A digital elevation model cropped to -60/60 degrees latitude and
aggregated by the requested factor
